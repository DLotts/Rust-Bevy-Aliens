Seems like space invaders classic, then suddenly the aliens fly out of their formation and attack!
(TODO)Then suddenly, you realize you are not constrained to the bottom of the screen,
you can go all around, then you can dive through the middle.  You barriers morph into something fun.
Then you realize you can fly outside the screen as the little spot where you started shrinks in the distance
and there's all kinds of havoc going on in neigboring areas.

Alternatively, starts the same classic space invaders, then same morphs into Galaxion,
then you fly forward and start pikcing up people as in Defender.  Oh no! asteroids start flying toward you!
Oh no, aliens are mining the little asteroids and creating a huge demonic boss, don't let them! Sinistar!

This is my first Bevy project and I had huge fun making it.  
Feel free to fork it and finish it or whatever and send me a merge request if you want.

Thanks,
david.

TODO
- edges of the screen seem larger than the screen and creatures live out there.  Heehee, this is maybe forshadowing for what comes next as you discover that you can fly out beyond the original screen boundary.  It's so cool how the screen boundaries are not bound to the game world and can change,

- Ship graphic

- all the cool stuff at the top.
